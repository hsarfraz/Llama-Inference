# Large language models (LLMs) Inference
Setting up Llama LLM inference On-Premise Environment

Large language models (LLMs) are a powerful tool with the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries. However, deploying and managing LLMs can be a complex and challenging task. This repo provides ready to use implemention details, ready built containers to perform LLMs in an on-premise environment. 

## Inference using Huggingface TGI
## Custom Inference Server with REST APIs


# Inference using Huggingface TGI
Three tier architecture for llm inference is used to perform on premise deployment. This architecture allows greater flexibility and agility. It is assumed that on premise hosting infrastructure is behind firewalls with no outbound connectivity to internet as part of security policies. 

### The three tiers consists of following:
1: Backend llm inference server â€“ huggingface TGI server
2: Web application server
3: Front-end using web browser

## Deliverables
- Web Interface to allow interaction with llm
- Deployment of following models:
  - Code LLama 7B, 13B 
  - LLama 7B
  - Falcon 7B

## Requirement
- docker
- Python 3.11 

Copy files from folder '01_inference_tgi_quantized' to your local GPU server. Adjust  containes needed docker compose file to create 2 docker containers. These containers can be deployed using below commands:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```


# Custom Inference Server with REST APIs
The basic implementation of an inference server requires the following components:
- Embedded Web UI for End User
- Provide REST APIs for external client usage
- Ability to load interact with LLM Model
- GPU with enough RAM to load the LLM model

## Requirement

- Python 3.10+ 
- Transformers, Datasets, Accelerate, PEFT and TRL
- gradio (used in web_demo.py)
- uvicorn and fastapi (used in api_demo.py)
